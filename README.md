## MLOps for COVID-19 Detection from X-ray Images
This repository contains the project "Application of MLOps Practices for COVID-19 Detection from X-ray Images" which focuses on building a machine learning model using deep learning techniques for the automatic detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. The project leverages pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as VGG-16 and DenseNet169, and implements MLOps practices with MLflow for model tracking and evaluation.

### Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to develop an automated tool for early COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images. The project utilizes MLOps practices to streamline the lifecycle of machine learning models, including development, training, validation, and deployment.

### Key Features:
MLOps: Model tracking using MLflow.
Models: Transfer learning with pre-trained CNN models (VGG-16, DenseNet169).
Data Augmentation: Techniques for handling class imbalance in the dataset.
Fine-Tuning: Adjusting model architecture for optimal performance.
